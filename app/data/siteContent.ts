    story: "If you're serious about finally getting in shape and making real changes, working with Onur is hands down the best decision you'll make. He's got the system, the knowledge, and the accountability to get you results but you have to be ready to commit. If you do, it's honestly life changing. When I started with Onur 12 weeks ago, I was at my heaviest and just felt completely stuck. I kept telling myself I'd get back on track, but nothing really changed. I knew I needed structure, someone to hold me accountable, and a plan that actually worked not just something I'd follow for a couple of weeks and then fall off again. And omg... it worked. In 12 weeks, I've dropped over 25 pounds, lost more than 10% body fat, and most importantly I finally feel in control of my health again. But it wasn't just about the weight. Onur helped me break the bad habits that kept me spinning my wheels, snacking, yo-yo dieting, obsessing over calories instead of focusing on the right foods. He didn't just hand me some generic plan; he actually adjusted things based on how my body was responding, what was working, what needed tweaking. That level of attention made all the difference. I've had trainers before. I've been in and out of the gym for years, and honestly, I thought I could figure it out on my own. But working with Onur was different. If you're tired of starting over and actually want to see real progress, this is it. Just commit, show up, and trust the process. You won't regret it.",
